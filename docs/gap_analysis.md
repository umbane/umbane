## Implementation Status Summary

| Component | Completion |
|-----------|------------|
| Smart Contract (Token.sol) | ~85% |
| Backend API | ~70% |
| Frontend (Basic) | ~60% |
| Hardware/Oracle | 0% |
| Trading Desk | 0% |
| Retirement/Pledging | 0% |
| Grid Purchase | 0% |
| DAO Governance | 0% |

## Token Architecture Decision

### Simplified Approach (Current MVP)

| Token | Symbol | Type | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| **Umbane** | UMB | Single ERC20 | Utility token for all purposes |

**Current Implementation:**
- Single `Umbane` (UMBANE) token deployed at `0xF5D3E95244E07444eCFfE9BF04418cF1Fe398aDe`
- Tracks `mJTotalSupply` and `aCTotalSupply` internally for accounting
- Both mJ and aC use the same UMB token (same balance)

### Granular Approach (Future Enhancement)

| Token | Symbol | Type | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| **Umbane** | UMB | ERC20 | Governance/utility |
| **mJ** | mJ | ERC20 | Energy token (minted per Wh) |
| **aC** | aC | ERC20 | Carbon credit token |

**When to migrate:**
- Phase 2+ when trading desk requires distinct tokens
- When Carbon Trading Desks need separate markets for energy vs carbon
- When regulatory clarity requires separation

## ✅ Completed Features

### Smart Contract (Amoy: `0xF5D3E95244E07444eCFfE9BF04418cF1Fe398aDe`)

| Feature | FR-ID | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| ERC20 UMBANE token | - | ✅ Done | Single token for all purposes |
| mJ minting (accounting) | FR-TM-01 | ✅ Done | Internal tracking only |
| aC minting (accounting) | FR-TM-02 | ✅ Done | Internal tracking only |
| Burn tokens | FR-TR-03 | ✅ Done | Single burn function for UMB |
| Carbon price tracking | - | ✅ Done | Manual/Chainlink future |
| Energy recording | FR-TM-03 | ✅ Done | User history stored |
| User history | FR-TM-03 | ✅ Done | Per-user records |
| Pending credits | FR-TM-04 | ✅ Done | Pending aC calculation |

**Note:** Current contract uses single UMB token for both mJ (energy) and aC (carbon). The PRD specifies separate tokens but we simplified for MVP.

### Backend API

| `/burnMJ`, `/burnAC` | ✅ |
| `/balance/*` | ✅ |
| `/total-supply` | ✅ |
| `/transactions/*` | ✅ |
| Carbon price feeds | ✅ |
| Carbon calculator | ✅ |
| `/chainlink/process-energy` | ✅ |

### Frontend

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| MetaMask wallet connection | ✅ |
| Polygon Amoy network switch | ✅ |
| Token balance display | ✅ |
| Total supply display | ✅ |
| Mint UI (owner only) | ✅ |
| Burn UI | ✅ |
| Carbon calculator | ✅ |
| Token add to wallet | ✅ |

## Technical Debt & Notes

1. **Contract ABI Mismatch**: Backend uses `mint()` but contract has `mintMJ()`/`mintAC()` - needs update
2. **No separate mJ/aC tracking**: Contract returns same balance for both - PRD says separate tokens
3. **Database not initialized**: Schema not provided - need `init_db.sql`
4. **No device registry**: Oracle needs to know valid device addresses
5. **No price feed**: Carbon price is manual - needs Chainlink integration

## Quick Wins

| Task | Effort | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Fix mint function name in backend | 1hr | High |
| Create database schema | 2hr | High |
| Add device registration endpoint | 4hr | High |
| Implement trading desk UI | 1wk | High |
